# Canteen-Management-System-Project-
Canteens are a go to place for any student or employee when they need a break from their hectic routine and have a snack or just gossip with their fellow classmates or colleagues. In their hectic routine they spare a very little time to visit the canteen. For that matter we want to provide a management system to reduce the customers waiting time.   Our project is based on canteen management system and the main objective of this project is to provide fast and easy service to the customers. This project will also allow the user to manage the food items, its sale, and the orders received and executed in a very systematic manner.
